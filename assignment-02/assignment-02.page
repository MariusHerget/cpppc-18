# 1: A Vector Class in C++

Port the [vector test suite](/assignment-01/a-01/test/vector_test.cc)
and your implementation of `Vector` from the first assignment to C++.

You can use the [Heap code example](/session-02/02-copy-assignment/)
discussed in the last session for reference.

- **Pay close attention to const-correctness!**
- **Use references instead of pointers where possible!**

You may use pointers instead of a nested iterator class for methods such as
`vector::begin()`, `vector::end()` but getting familiar with the C++ iterator
concept is recommended.


See:

- [C++ STL vector container](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector)
- [C++ STL iterator concept](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/Iterator)


# Additional Remarks

Remember the lesson you learned from the first assignment?

> Concepts can be implemented using existing types.

In the last lab session, we also discovered:

> The best resource/ownership management is the one you delegate.

And remembering the Rule of Zero:

> Ideally, a class only contains members that are either plain old
> data or implement the Rule of X (X in { 0, 3, 5 }).

You might want to have a look at the documentation of `std::vector`.
