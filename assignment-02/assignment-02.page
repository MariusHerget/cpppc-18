# 1: A Vector Class in C++

Port the [vector test suite](/assignment-01/a-01/test/vector_test.cc)
and your implementation of `Vector` from the first assignment to C++.

You can use the [Heap code example](/session-02/02-copy-assignment/)
discussed in the last session for reference.

**Pay close attention to const-correctness!**

Implementing methods that require iterators such as
`vector::begin()`, `vector::end()` is not mandatory, but getting familiar with
the C++ iterator concept is recommended.
