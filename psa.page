...

I will do everything humanly possible to assist with the assignments and
of course I gladly discuss your questions - "No student left behind".
But consider this (anonymized) screenshot of my inbox, in particular date
and time of the mails I received (and replied to). \
May 1st *actually* is a holiday and yes, times in the screenshot are local time. \
You surely understand I cannot maintain this kind of 24/7 service in the
future. \

Note that
**every submission of assignment 2 so far had significant erros and needed clarification**.
As mentioned several times before: the need for further - ideally personal - clarification is unsurprising. C++ is hard, and it's not your fault.
But it's your fault for knowing this and procrastinating your work until
literally less than 24 hours before the submission deadline.

There is no way to fail assignments or this course in general **if** you start working
on assignments and discussing questions early!
And if even I cannot help,
[there still is crying](http://www.spiegel.de/lebenundlernen/uni/universitaet-in-utah-bietet-heulschrank-fuer-studenten-an-a-1205268.html).



**START WORKING ON YOUR ASSIGNMENTS RIGHT AWAY**
